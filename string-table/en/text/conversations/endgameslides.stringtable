      <DefaultText>At your command, the ancient device became your instrument, spinning to life with deafening resonance and gathering up the swirling essence like thread on a great spindle.

There, in the pale, pulsing glow of the machine that set you on this path long ago, you summoned all your strength, focusing on your objective and blocking out all else. With a single, concussive blast that rocked the chamber and sent you tumbling to the ground, you freed the souls from their stasis.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With your business concluded, Hiravias quietly took his leave and headed home to Thein Bog.

The elders of the Fisher Crane had not warmed to Hiravias in his absence, and when he arrived, he was denounced and scorned. Hiravias spoke of his deeds and of his communion with Galawain - yet none would support his petition to return to the tribe.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hiravias took his leave of the party and, after his first bath in years, returned to his nomadic lifestyle.

With his homesickness expunged, he found renewed joy and tranquility in his wandering survey of the wilderness. For the first time in his life, he ventured beyond sight of the mountains of Eir Glanfath. During his travels, he penned numerous journals and sketches detailing his travels through frozen tundra, searing desert, and tropical forests.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>One by one, starting with the oldest, Hiravias challenged each member of the council to single combat - humiliating the rîow in a series of savage duels.

With half the council bloodied and shamed, the elders at last acknowledged Hiravias' strength, announcing him a hunter of the Fisher Crane tribe.

Upon being granted this title, Hiravias calmly left the village and embarked again on his life of wandering.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With the birth of his Hollowborn child, the last threads of Lord Raedric's sanity frayed and broke apart, his wife the first victim of his wrath.

With a fortress to protect him and a garrison of loyal soldiers at his command, he continued to snuff out all signs of resistance from the citizens of Gilded Vale, real or perceived. In the end, all would hang from the boughs of the village's trees, watching over their dead town with vacant eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Lord Raedric's zeal had brought him back to life once, but it would not do so again. Raedric's destruction at your hands spelled the end of his suffocating rule over Gilded Vale and the surrounding area. In his absence, the village prospered, becoming a popular destination for new settlers anxious to leave Defiance Bay after the riots. 

Without a nearby ruler, it also grew more wild, with many settlers moving on as soon as they'd arrived, turned off by lawlessness that was excessive even by Dyrwoodan standards. Nevertheless, despite the challenges of living there, Gilded Vale had survived, and would continue to survive for the foreseeable future.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though you had killed Lord Raedric in his throne room, so strong was his drive to rid his land of Eothasians that he returned to life as a deathguard, a deathless crusader for his brutal cause. With the remains of his humanity stripped away, Raedric came to see all the people of Gilded Vale as worshippers of Eothas, and one day he led his forces into the village personally to see them all purged from his lands. Gilded Vale was left a hollow shell, its buildings ruined and its people slaughtered. Even travelers and would-be squatters knew better than to take refuge inside its borders. 

Lord Raedric returned to Raedric's Hold, where he remained, keeping eternal watch over his barren domain.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The duc's assassination at the apparent hands of an animancer had caused catastrophic rioting in the streets of Defiance Bay, but those who had escaped the melee in the palace hearings remembered the testimonies of the strange guest who had shown up that day and absolved animancy, implicating the Leaden Key instead. 

The rumor spread quickly, and soon the popular belief was that the assassin had been a Leaden Key spy.</DefaultText>

Many Dyrwoodans took the end of Waidwen's Legacy as a sign both that the gods did not approve of animancy and that the purging of animancers in Defiance Bay had been enough to satisfy them. In time, their rage would subside, and a number of surviving animancers remained in and around Defiance Bay, often taking to the wilds to practice their science without repercussions.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>But order would soon come from an unexpected source. House Doemenel, realizing that stability was good for business, brought the city's criminal elements in line through a systematic campaign of fear and intimidation.

Capitalizing on a reputation for brazen fearlessness earned with the murder of a marshal of the Crucible Knights, the Doemenels aggressively pressed their authority, murdering all would-be rivals and collecting coin from all transactions in the city and becoming arguably the most influential house in all of Dyrwood. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>But once the Dozens had regrouped in the wake of the riots, they quickly put an end to the criminal activity, patrolling the streets in droves and administering their brand of law on any perceived offenders.

They also took the opportunity to depose the weakened Knights of the Crucible from their position of authority, branding them traitors to the people for their actions during the riots. Whatever Knights weren't stoned to death in front of their keep were forced into exile. The external contingent of Knights stationed at Fleetbreaker Castle would remain there, their High Justice plotting the city's recapture.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The destruction of the machine atop Teir Nowneth spelled the end of the reanimated corpses in Heritage Hill. Though at first few were willing to venture into the abandoned district, it was soon cleaned out and rebuilt. The district's horrors still fresh in people's minds, it would be some time before it was fully repopulated, but eventually the lure of cheap, prime land would all but erase the memory.</DefaultText>

Heritage Hill was rebuilt, and no sooner had the first families moved in to resettle the district than members of the Leaden Key, acting under standing orders from their grandmaster, climbed the tower and reactivated the machine.

The initiates slew a handful of the new settlers under cover of night and watched as history repeated itself, the victims reanimating and devouring the survivors. After this second incident, the district would remain abandoned.</DefaultText>

The swirling souls held captive in Sun in Shadow were swept into the great adra pillar there, sent barreling down through the world's veins to places unknown to mortal sight.

Though no word would reach your ears of their arrival, by the time you had returned to Twin Elms, word had spread of a miracle on their Burial Isle, and pious Glanfathans were already streaming in from all over to observe the statue of Woedica there, its once-broken crown now fully restored.</DefaultText>

Many who survived the famine would soon freeze to death in their own homes.</DefaultText>

To wrong Galawain, then, is truly to wake the beast, and the Father of Monsters took great umbrage at your broken promise to him. Along with Magran and Abydon, Galawain embarked upon a more direct approach to claiming his quarry.

In the months that followed, the frontier settlements of Dyrwood were inexplicably attacked by packs of beasts and monsters, suddenly organized and unafraid to approach kith on their own land. Many such villages were all but destroyed by the time troops could be dispatched from local garrisons.</DefaultText>

With the Dyrwood's people strengthened by the Watcher's gift of souls, the Vailian Republics found themselves struggling to keep up with their new competitors. For her outrageous insubordination and audacity, Pallegina was banished from the Republics for several years. After the southern forest of Eir Glanfath opened to both the Republics and the Dyrwood, the Vailians found that the combined efforts of all three nations had created a robust trade network. The ducessa of Biageppe granted Pallegina a pardon for her foresight, though it took many years for her to regain the trust of her superiors and brothers in the order.</DefaultText>

Strengthened by the Watcher's gift of souls, the furious Dyrwoodans waged war against the Republics for two long years. The Republics gained a great deal of wealth in trade, but suffered the loss of many trade vessels and thousands of lives. Several of the ducal families lost favor with their citizens. Riots in Selona claimed the life of that city's duc, and the other ducs bels were pressured into relinquishing their exclusive trade rights to end the conflict with the Dyrwood. Pallegina had been honored for her service at the opening of trade, but her reputation among the ducs and within the Brotherhood was not tarnished by what followed.</DefaultText>

Believing now that it was the obligation of kith to be the leaders their gods had not, Edér was soon named mayor of the town, and under his guidance, Dyrford soon began to prosper. He expelled the last of the Skaenites from the area and drew new settlers with the offer of land, a trick he had learned from someone he otherwise preferred to forget.

Standing before the lore college, Kana Rua explained that the tablet he sought had been destroyed, and so a true interpretation of the Tanvii ora Toha could no longer exist - the people of Rauatai would have to create their own. He described the many strange things he had seen in his travels, and announced his intent to pursue the accumulation of knowledge abroad, seeking answers to new questions. </DefaultText>

What became of him remains a mystery. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After all that he had learned in the Watcher's company, Kana Rua could no longer see meaning in his pursuit of the Tanvii ora Toha. He decided to leave what remained of it within the depths of the Endless Paths, and return home. Kana bid the Watcher farewell and sailed back to Rauatai, spending the tempestuous journey reflecting on the time he had lost to the pursuit of falsehoods. 

His family found Kana much changed, his fiery excitement replaced with a weary solemnity. Determined to change his wandering ways, Kana took up a quiet life as a lore keeper at the college, teaching young students the traditions of their people.</DefaultText>

The Grieving Mother sought a place where she might do penance for the Birthing Bell. She returned to Dyrford, where, to the astonishment of the villagers, she delivered the first healthy child in over a decade. She remained there, and with each new birth, she saw a measure of hope restored to the Dyrwood and a measure of grace for her own troubled past.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Durance used Magran's strength only until Thaos had been cast from the world and then swore off her influence entirely. Regret came to weigh heavily on his mind, and a man who had never previously lacked for words or opinions came to embrace silence and contemplation.

He continued to wander, penniless and destitute, searching now not for the reason for his goddess' silence, but for a mechanism for revenge. The charred robes he continued to wear as a reminder that he had been burned by his goddess, and not just by the flames of the Godhammer.</DefaultText>

When only silence came, he took it as a condemnation of his continued existence.

Ultimately, he built a pyre and threw himself upon it, using his own shattered staff as kindling.</DefaultText>

They were quickly reinforced by returning forces from Fleetbreaker Castle.

Having seen both the ills and the promise of animancy, internally the Knights quietly began a more cautious exploration of the new science. Depleted in numbers but bolstered by their newly forged stock of soul-augmented weaponry and a small contingent of forge knights, the Knights of the Crucible would soon become an order few in Defiance Bay would dare to cross.</DefaultText>
