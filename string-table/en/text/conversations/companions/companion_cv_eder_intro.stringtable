      <DefaultText>He extends his hand. "Name's Edér.

"Though to the people around here, might as well be 'Nineteen.'"

He looks you up and down and grimaces. "Don't think I'd put you much higher than Twenty-two, Twenty-three tops." He tsks. "You look like the sort that likes to get involved."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was smoking over here, saw you staring at her. Twice I refilled my pipe. You never so much as blinked. Your mouth was so slack I took you for a Raedric at first."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He glances about quickly, then leans in. "Careful, friend. Best not use that word 'round here. Could be any number of Raedric bootlickers within earshot.

"Ciphers, animancers, Watchers... same thing in the eyes of folks around here, Raedric especially. They come through these parts all the time with their 'cures,' preying on the desperate. None of them are who they claim to be."</DefaultText>

      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Fair enough. If folks around here minded their business then that tree over there'd have a few less wind chimes. Maybe I should take heed.

      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Course seeing you with that funny look, I'd be halfway inclined to believe you WERE having some kind of communion with that dwarf.

      <DefaultText>"Saint's War. Only one in my lifetime. Fella decides he's the living incarnation of Eothas. Overthrows Readceras. Marches on Dyrwood. So we gave him a Dyrwoodan Hello."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He sighs and shakes his head, his eyes fixed on the tree. "Bound to happen sooner or later. If not for plotting against Raedric then for protecting me."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>He looks up at the tree, his eyes trailing one of the swaying bodies. "Seems that's no longer a concern.

"Of course, the townies don't do the hanging these days, but when Raedric's men come they got no problem doing the pointing."</DefaultText>

      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Raedric sent men down here the other day. Said they had it on good authority someone in town was working with Kolsc. Plotting Raedric's overthrow.

"Said if he didn't come forward right then and there, they'd hang every last one of us."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No one was coming forward. So Swithin - that's my headman - he steps up and says it's him.

    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>He shrugs. "Picked the wrong god. That's what it comes down to. 

"Used to be a lot of Eothas worshipers in Gilded Vale. That mess of rocks over there was a temple to him, to give you some idea."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Then one day somebody named Waidwen shows up on Dyrwood's doorstep. Says he's the living flesh of Eothas. Got an army with him. Suddenly Eothas isn't so popular in these parts.

"My brother Woden and me, neither of us believed it. No way was that Eothas. He enlisted, then I did too. But he didn't make it back."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"After the war, people took to punishing Eothas worshipers. Accusing them of treason. Got real ugly, especially after the Legacy started. Folks needed someone to blame."

"I was safe because I fought, but then this rumor starts that my brother, that he was on the wrong side. Then I wasn't so safe anymore - not till my headman stepped in, said they'd have to hang him to get to me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Point of fact, I'm on my way out. Just haven't figured where I'm going yet.

      <DefaultText>He shrugs. "All right, then. Guess I'll do some sightseeing."

    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Seem to remember hearing something about that, years ago. He tamed that place. People would seek him out for all kinds of things. Troubles of the soul. Questions for the departed. 

"Course, that was back when you didn't have to say Watcher with a hush on your breath."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>He scratches his beard absently with a callused thumb. 

"Not sure how I feel about setting out with a stranger - and a strange one at that. But truth be told you might be the only one in town who wouldn't feel some relief seeing me swing from that tree."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He gives an understanding nod as he takes a long drag from his pipe. "My condolences."

He exhales and turns his attention away, watching the village around him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The smell of pipe smoke, at once earthy and sweet, winds its way into your nostrils. Your eyes trace the smoke to its origin, where you find a broad man with straw-colored hair leaning against a mossy rock wall, his pipe held to his lips with one meaty hand.

He looks you directly in the eye, but the look is not aggressive. He regards you with a peculiar smirk.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thing about Woden was, he always knew what was right, and that's what he'd do. One day he set out to fight for Dyrwood against a man claiming to be our god. So I knew that's what I had to do too. It was right.

"Hearing claims that he died fighting for Readceras, that got me worried. Not that he'd chosen the wrong side, but that I had. Didn't seem right, what Waidwen had in store, but if he really was Eothas..." He shakes his head.</DefaultText>
