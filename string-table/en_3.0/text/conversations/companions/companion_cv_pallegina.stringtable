      <DefaultText>"Gods damn that son of a cur!" The angry woman clenches her jaw and stares out toward the harbor with glimmering golden eyes. Eventually sensing your presence, she turns her feathered head toward you.</DefaultText>

      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>"True enough. Verzano's just lucky no one's trying to pay him in steel these days." She grits her teeth. "Sooner or later, his luck will run out."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You want to help? Sure. Go into that warehouse and ask for a man named Verzano. When you find him, throw him in a sack, throw the sack in a crate, and put the crate on a boat headed to Ancenze."</DefaultText>

      <ID>17</ID>
      <DefaultText>She thinks for a moment before continuing in an angry tone. "Or the bottom of the Pearlwood Gulf. Either's fine with me."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Verzano wrings his hands. "Your timing is impeccable, Tella Pallegina. The Doemenels are after me. Please, you've got to stop them."</DefaultText>

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>Pallegina snorts. "As if any of this were ever in my hands. The Republics considered your business worth protecting based on its success. That success depended on cooperation with the locals, like House Doemenel. You've lost that..." her golden eyes narrow. "... and the favor of the ducs."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Even if you get out of this alive, they're done with you. The ducs have more pressing interests in Defiance Bay than rescuing one merchant who threw himself overboard."</DefaultText>

      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>Verzano falls to his knees and clasps his hands together. "Have mercy, Pallegina. I don't stand a chance against the Doemenels." He bites a trembling lip. "I've brought failure and shame on myself, but you can't mean to watch your countryman die like a dog." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Pallegina stares at Verzano for a long moment. The nictitating membranes of her eyes slide out and back before she continues. "Verzano, Verzano... why are you wasting your precious breath on me? My orders come through the ambassador, and through the ambassador, from people you should be honored ever gave a moment's thought to whether you live or die."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Pallegina's feathers flare, but she doesn't turn to face you. "I have every intention of staying out of this, as do the ducs bels."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The meaning's simple. Verzano's cut off, shut out. His fate is left to the Doemenels and whatever unlucky friends he may still have in Defiance Bay."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>Pallegina drops her gaze and lightly shakes her head from side to side. Moments later, she turns her eyes to the ceiling in amused disbelief.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ha ha ha! Oh, Verzano, you have a saint looking out for you after all." She strides across the room and takes the already-nervous Verzano's head in her feathered hands, a gesture that seems to hover in a dangerously narrow space between caressing and crushing.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Just don't come knocking on the embassy door. Understand?" Verzano replies with a rapid, weak series of nods. Pallegina nods back once and gives his face a light slap.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Verzano turns his tear-streaked face to you. "I know I put you in a difficult position, but please believe that I never thought either of us would come to harm. I only did what was necessary to save my business and bring honor to my country.

"Please, I beg for your mercy."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Verzano turns his tear-streaked face to you. "I know you have a kind heart. Please, I never meant for either of us to come to harm. I only wanted to save my business.

      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>Verzano turns his face to you and laughs bitterly through his tears. "I know better than to ask you for mercy. Our Pallegina is as gentle as the Sky-Mother by comparison."</DefaultText>

      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>Verzano turns his tear-streaked face to you. "Please, the Doemenels will cut me to pieces. But you could stop them. Everyone in Defiance Bay knows what you're capable of."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Verzano plays with fire and someone else always pays the price for it." Pallegina sighs. "Your charity is more than he deserves. Still, at least I don't have to deal with him anymore. For that, I'm grateful."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I always knew Verzano's bad dealings would catch up with him. I didn't expect his end to come from an outsider, but I suppose his ability to offend reached beyond this little circle."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You did the right thing. Verzano has no one to blame for this but himself. We gave him more than enough warnings, but he never listened." She shakes her feathered head and smiles faintly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah. Well, if you change your mind, I'll be at the embassy. It's southwest of the ducal palace. First Fires." Her golden eyes glimmer with the last word. "Corès." She smiles faintly and taps her middle finger to her thumb twice before turning to leave.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Good. Maybe I can finally do something more worthwhile than playing nanny to merchants." She smiles. "The embassy is up in First Fires, southwest of the ducal palace."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She's dead? I can't thank you enough, aimico. But it won't stop the Doemenels for long. I've got to get out of here, and I recommend that you do, too."

He gives you a bag of coin with shaking hands. "That's all I have after this ill-fated venture. Thank you again, and please, look out for yourself."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You clearly have pursuits of your own in the city, but I think we could help each other out - if you're interested in doing some work for us."
